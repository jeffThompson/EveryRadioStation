		* Description: 
		*	Initializes the Si4735, powers up the radio in the desired mode and limits the bandwidth appropriately.
		* 	This function must be called before any other radio command.
		*	The bands are set as follows:
		*	FM - 87.5 - 107.9 MHz
		*	AM - 520 - 1710 kHz
		*	SW - 2300 - 23000 khz
		*	LW - 152 - 279 kHz
		* Parameters:
		*	mode - The desired radio mode. Use AM(0), FM(1), SW(2) or LW(3).

		*				in the Si4735 Programmers Guide.
